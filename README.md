# Tests for the Conway project

This repo contains tests for functionality in the Conway project.

It is not meant to contain parent classes for the tests of Conway-based applications. For that, please refer to the
`conway.acceptance` repo.

To run the tests, change directories to the `src` folder and simply type this on a Bash shell:

```
python -m unittest
```
